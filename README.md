# Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Launcher
Launcher for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 aimed to fix manual setting host IP. Bonus is the new server configuratior (maps, limits, etc.).

Note that this launcher is developed for the IWNetServer. So it might not work for every type of game.

Also note that this is just a quick and dirty hobby project, so things might not work as it should on your computer. Although, there isn't much that can do damage (in fact, there should be nothing). 

# Usage

- Place the application (.exe or .jar) in the same folder as your Modern Warfare 2 files. 
- Run the application.
- Click one of your local IP's and click Start Server to create a local server.
- Click Start Client to run the client to play the game.

Other server IP's (hosts) can be used. Click Scan to scan the local area network for other computers (increase timeout time if hosts are missing). Then click the desired host and start the client.

## Custom folder

When placed in another folder than the Modern Warfare 2 folder, you can specify the path to the Modern Warfare 2 files in the .properties file.

## Server/Map config

When you've configured your settings and click Send, the application will try to focus the client console and send the new configuration to it. If this fails for some reason, the desired settings are still available on your clipboard. Just past them yourself wherever you want.

Note that this config uses console commands to communicate the settings to Modern Warfare 2.
